looping statements:
-to execute the block of code repeatedly.
for loop:executed when we know exact iteration count.
syntax:for(intialization;condition;updation){
}
while:executed whenwe dont know the number of iterations.
while(condition){
    }
do while:
do{
}
while(condition){
}

-entry controlled loops:for and while
-exit control loops:do while.
what is min iteration count of  for loop?
--1
what is min iteration count of while?
--0
what is min iteration count of do while?
--1
function:
-function is a block of code used to execute specific task assigned to code
-function is a non-primitive datatype
-function can be reusable.

syntax:function function_name(optional parametres){
                //Statements
                }
                function_name(arguments);
-a value in function is known as arguments.
Types of function:
1.Named function
2.Anonymous function
3.Function Expression
4.Immediate invoke function Expression(IIFE):CAlled only once
5.Arrow function
6.Higher order function
-- A function which accepts another function as an argument.
7.Callback function:which is passed as an argument to hof function.
--closure:It is a memory  where functions are bundled together or nested each other by giving an accesibility to the innermost fun to acces the variability to outermost function.

1.Named Function:
-function which is defined with name and invoked with same name
2.Anonymous Function:
-function which does not have a name to declare and to invoke.
-cannot be executed for itself.
3.Function Expression:
-anonymous function body or declaration is assigned and invoked with the same variable
4.Immediate invoke function Expression(IIFE):
-once the function is crested imeediately it should be invoked.
5.Arrow function:
-es6:ECMA Scripts
Europian computer Manufacturing association:handles updation related to js
current version:es14
-es6 is a stable version.
-syntax:()=>{};

what is return keyword?
-

Arrays:


map():
--It is used to iterate values from the Arrays
--If we return value ,map() method returns new copied.
foreach():
--It is used to iterate the values from the array.

What is Object?
--Object is an entity which is having an state (Properties) and states.
--Object is used to store the data in the form of key and value.
syntax:- let obj={};

note:"this" - It is used to target current executing Object 

JSON:Javascript Object notation
-JSON is a lightweight technique of js used to transfer data from client to server and viceversa.
-JSON is always in the form of "String".



Methods:
1.JSON.Stringify():It is used to convert js into json Object
2.JSON.Parse():it is used to convert JSON object into js object.

Asynchronous in js:
-to perform multiple tasks in js.
1.setTimeout():it is a web api used,to perform async operation at specified setTimeout
syntax;-setTimeout(Callback,timeout)

2.setInterval():-it is a web api used to perform async operation at specific time.
syntax:setInterval(callback fn,timeout);


3.promise:promise is an object which represents eventual completion or failure of an async operations.
    states of promise:
    1.pending state
    2.fulfilled state
    3.rejected state

syntax:- let p=new Promise((resolve,reject)=>{});
-the actual way of exexcuting promise is instance methods,
        1.then():-it is used to execute the fulfill state
        2.catch():-it is used to execute the rejected state
        3.finally()

4.async and await
a
note:-by defult, js is synchronous(single threaded).

DOM:
*****
--Document Object Model
--DOM is used to add ,remove,update to content in html document.
